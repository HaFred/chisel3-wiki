Getting started with Chisel should be fairly simple. 

You will need the [Java Programming Language](https://java.com/en/) installed on your machine.  This is often already installed.

You will need the Scala based *Simple Build tool* [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org) installed on your machine.  You can install it using the instructions at [Installing SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Setup.html) or if you are on a Apple OSX base system consider using [Brew](http://brew.sh/) as described here [Install sbt on mac](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Mac.html)

Once you have sbt installed, use [The Chisel Tutorial](/ucb-bar/chisel-tutorial) or [The Chisel Template](/ucb-bar/chisel-template) to get started

Good Luck!
